In order to use the XCode project, you'll need to do the following:Open the XCode project. Under the 'Project' menu, select 'Edit Active Executable', go to the'General' tab and change 'Set the working directory to:' to 'Project directory'.Otherwise, the application will not be able to find its input files (shaders etc)when running from within XCode.Note that this exercise requires the 'libpng' library. An easy way to install itis by using MacPorts:1. Install MacPorts:   a) Download and install MacPorts from http://www.macports.org/   b) Append the following lines to the file '~/.profile':        export PATH=$PATH:/opt/local/bin        export MANPATH=$MANPATH:/opt/local/share/man        export INFOPATH=$INFOPATH:/opt/local/share/info2. Install libpng:   Type 'sudo port install libpng'
