In case you run into issues with linking GDI+ correctly, please consider the following steps for trouble-shooting:1.) Check if Windows SDK is installed and verify the GDI+ paths in cmake/FindGDIPLUS.cmake.2.) If the paths are correct and you still run into linking issues, link the library manually:	a) Open the Visual Studio solution in the build folder.	b) Select the project "LightingAndShading" in the Solution Explorer.	c) Right-click on the project, then select Properties > Linker > Input.	d) Add gdiplus.lib to "Additional Dependencies".	e) Click OK.	f) Rebuild "LightingAndShading" (i.e., right-click > Rebuild).
